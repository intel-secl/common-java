/**
 * A CertificateRepository represents a source of trusted certificates for
 * the verification being attempted. This means if there is a global trusted root
 * CA list and a per-server list they should be combined by the implementation
 * to provide one coherent view to the TlsPolicy.
 * 
 * All methods in this interface return an Iterable, which could either be a "static" List
 * or it could be a handle into a database query that buffers results for the caller.
 * 
 * Caller must be able to call iterator() multiple times and get either the same or updated results.
 * 
 * Please note that this interface does NOT include any search methods for 
 * implementation-specific fields such as "comments", or "enabled", or "alias". 
 * Applications should extend this interface to add such search methods for their
 * own use.
