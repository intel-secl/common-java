/**
 * Provides a simple read-only interface to configuration properties. 
 * 
 * The {@code getString} methods return null if a key is not present or if
 * it's present but has a null value. 
 * 
 * Null values are treated as missing properties. 
 * 
 * To check if a key is present, call {@code keys().contains()} - this does
 * not guarantee that the key has a value as this may be implementation dependent
 * but implementations SHOULD NOT advertise keys that have null values.
 * 
 * Configuration settings are all strings. The programmer may use a decorator
 * to automatically parse strings into numbers, ranges, URLs, comma-separated
 * lists, etc. For large objects such as keystores it is recommended to 
 * store them in a data repository and only put file location, password, 
 * key handles, etc. in the configuration.
 * 
 * In desktop applications the user's preferences may generally be changed
 * from anywhere in the user interface where it's most convenient. In
 * server applications the configuration is generally not changed on the fly
 * and when it is it typically requires special privileges. The isEditable
 * method is provided to allow applications to determine whether a specific
 * Configuration instance allows editing.
