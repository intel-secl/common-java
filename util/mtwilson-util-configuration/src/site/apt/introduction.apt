Introduction

Apache Commons Configuration defines a "normal" Configuration interface which
is mutable and inherits from a ImmutableConfiguration interface. This is
awkward - checking to see if a configuration instance is mutable means just 
checking if it is an instance of Configuration. But there's no way to check
if an instance is immutable - because all instances inherit from ImmutableConfiguration.

Doing it the other way makes more sense. Starting with a Configuration interface
which is immutable, and having a subinterface which is a MutableConfiguration 
allows programmers to know more intuitively whether the instance is readonly or
mutable.
