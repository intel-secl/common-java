/**
 * You may initialize this trust delegate with a mutable public key repository
 * to which new public keys can be added (with user permission).  
 * 
 * This delegate may not be initialized without a repository because that would
 * mean every public key is a "first public key" and therefore would be trusted,
 * which is equivalent to an insecure policy that doesn't require a delegate,
 * but most importantly will not be able to implement the purpose of this delegate
 * which is to only trust a public key if the repository is empty and then add it
 * to the repository.
 * 
 * Difference between this class and FirstCertificateTrustDelegate is that this
 * class does not validate the certificate at all and only stores the public key.
