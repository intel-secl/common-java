/**
 * The JarFileClassLoader can load classes from a single jar file. If a named class is not found
 * in the jar file, the findClass method returns null.  This is because in this system it's normal
 * not to find a given class because it may be in other jar files which are handled by separate
 * JarFileClassLoaders. So the parent class loader is in charge of trying all available class loaders
 * before delegating to its grand-parent class loader, likely the default class loader
 * (which would throw ClassNotFoundException if the
 * class is not found at that point).
 * 
 * XXX TODO the jarfileclassloader is only being used by classloadertest and reflectionstest... 
 * it's useful to have it inside the container for the reflections test but other than that it should really be in the 
 * launcher where all the class loader magic will be.   OR, since the value added by this class is really 
 * the part about opening the JarFile and using JarEntry to read files and how to convert a fully qualified
 * class name into a path to a class in the jar file,  maybe that little bit of behavior can be refactored into
 * a JarFileClassFinder which accepts the fully qualified class name and returns either null or the byte array,
 * and this can be used by a JarFileClassLoader anywhere and doesn't necessarily change the class loading rules
 * like ModuleClassLoader does.
