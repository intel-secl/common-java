/**
 * The LimitedClassLoader behaves differently than the standard ClassLoader: instead of checking the parent first, the
 * LimitedClassLoader looks at its own resources first, and if it doesn't find the class it checks the parent, only
 * throwing a ClassNotFoundException if the parent also cannot find the class (and typically this never happens as the
 * parent itself would probably throw ClassNotFoundException).
 *
 * The LimitedClassLoader allows the application to set two filters:
 *
 * The exclusion filter, if set, excludes classes from this behavior, which defers their loading to the standard java
 * ClassLoader. Classes in java.* are excluded by default and cannot be removed from the exclusion filter. However more
 * packages can be added to the exclusion filter.
 *
 * The inclusion filter, if set, limits the "look inside first" behavior ONLY to included classes, and automatically
 * looks to the standard class loader for everything else.
 *
 * Setting both filter combines the behavior, so that we only "look down" for classes accepted by the inclusion filter
 * AND not also excluded.
