/**
 * One class loader per module loads its internal implementation and all its dependencies privately. A parent class
 * loader loads all classes that are not in modules such as java.* classes as well as designated public packages.
 * Modules designate internal implementation classes by storing them under a package name such as *.impl.* or
 * *.internal.*. This allows modules to define complex data types with their API which other modules can use, while
 * keeping other classes private and clearly marked so. The
 * complex data types can only use what they provide in the public API and java.* classes. The public complex data types
 * may not refer to any classes defined in the internal implementation packages (but private implementation classes may
 * refer to the public classes). This is easy to construct by using
 * public interfaces and abstract classes that are implemented by private classes or subclasses. 
 * 
 * Uses one
 * MultiJarFileClassLoader per module for its dependencies and a ModulePrivateClassLoader for the module jar itself
 * which loads only the internal implementation classes leaving the public classes for a parent class loader; and uses
 * one MultiJarFileClassLoader for the entire container which is a parent class loader that loads only module public
 * APIs from module jars (and does not reference any dependency jars, in order to enforce that modules use only java.*
 * classes or its own provided public classes in its public APIs).
 * 
 * The fencing works like this:
 * By default, all classes except those in the java.*  package are loaded privately
 * If you specify an exclude filter, then all classes except those in java.* and those "accepted" by the exclude filter
 * will be loaded privately.  Excluding means to exclude from the fenced private area.
 * If you specify an include filter, then all classes "accepted" by the filter (except those in java.*) will be
 * loaded privately. Including means to include in the fenced private area.
 * If you specify both an include filter and an exclude filter, then all classes "accepted" by the include filter
 * except those in java.* and those "accepted" by the exclude filter will be loaded privately. So it's a combination
 * of both, and excluding takes precedence (if a class matches criteria for both inclusion and exclusion, it will
 * be excluded).
