 * You can call getCurrent() and getMax() to get the progress as 
 * the task that is being executed or was last completed vs the
 * number of tasks in the collection.
 * 
 * The difference between a TaskCollection and a TaskManager is that
 * the progress of a TaskCollection is just the number of tasks
 * completed out of the number of tasks in the collection, while 
 * the progress of a TaskManager takes into account the progress of
 * sub-tasks.
