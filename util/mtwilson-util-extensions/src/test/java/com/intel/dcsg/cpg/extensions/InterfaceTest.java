/**
 * This junit test is an example of one approach to extensible APIs, using
 * an "envelope" object to store the core request and extended attributes
 * The envelope reminds me of SOAP, and the client and server code both 
 * need to explicitly create envelopes and store attributes in them.
 * The idea of main content and extended attributes probably is nice for
 * helping developers keep the API forward-compatible with an "add only"
 * strategy using the extensions, but on the other hand it can become
 * strange to see what future additions do as extensions when they might
 * be seen as additions (or even required new additions) to the main request.
 * Overall it might be better to have a layout where initial and later 
 * attributes are on "equal footing" while maintaining an easy "add only"
 * mechanism.
