/**
 * This is a convenience base class for input validators - objects that
 * accept a String, and convert it to an Object if it's a
 * valid representation. Examples of String input are form fields and database
 * fields. The created Object is not necessarily a Model.
 * 
 * Extend InputModel instead of ObjectModel when
 * you need a re-usable input validator to create Model or non-Model instances.
 * InputModel instances are intended to be re-used to parse additional
 * input and create corresponding Object instances (that do not necessarily
 * implement Model), 
 * whereas ObjectModel instances represent a single input or value.
 * 
 * For example in order to create a re-usable Integer-within-range validator
 * you could create a subclass of InputModel<Integer> and implement the range
 * conditions. Callers can then use isValid() to learn about the input and
 * value() to obtain the validated Integer representation. Integer itself does
 * not have to implement Model. Another example is to set restrictions on String
 * input, such as minimum or maximum length, allowed characters, etc. If the
 * restrictions are part of the application's object model they should probably
 * be implemented as a subclass of ObjectModel, but if they are intended to 
 * prevent cross-site scripting, SQL injection, etc. they are essentially 
 * perimeter checks and once validated the String object is fine to use in
 * the application - that's a good candidate for extending InputModel<String>
 * to validate the input.
 * 
 * You can construct an InputModel with a given value, or you can use the
 * empty constructor and provide the value later.  Validation does not happen
 * until you call either isValid() or value().  Validation only happens once
 * per input - repeated calls to isValid() or value() will NOT re-validate
 * if the input has not changed.
 * 
 * You can call setInput(String) to set or change the input. This will
 * cause it to be validated the next time you call isValid() or value().
 * 
 * Because you can reset the input, you can construct just one instance of
 * this class and re-use it to validate all input of the same type. Valid
 * inputs always instantiate new model objects so the return value will 
 * only be the same object if you call value() multiple times without changing
 * the input.
 *
