Introduction

Apache Commons Codec defines same-to-same codec interfaces. For
example, the Encoder interface is encode Object->Object, the BinaryEncoder
interface is encode byte[]->byte[], and the StringEncoder interface is
encode String->String.

There are certainly applications for such same-to-same codecs, and of course
the common ones are already included in commons-codec.

However, there is another category of encoding/decoding interfaces that
is useful but not included in commons-codec:  encode Object->byte[] and
encode byte[]->String are also known as serialization and its useful
to define different encoders implementing these interfaces. For example,
an ASN.1 DER encoder can implement encode Object->byte[] for X509Certificate
objects, and a PEM encoder can implement encode byte[]->String for any
DER-encoded object (actually any byte array can be base64-encoded and 
wrapped with PEM-style banners).
