/**
 * Probably the DepthFirstTreeIterator is easier to use since the caller is the visitor, so there's
 * one less argument to create and no need to make a one-off implementation of the visitor interface.
 * 
 * XXX TODO Maybe the search class should be re-purposed to use the iterator to traverse the tree and keep track 
 * of nodes that "match" given criteria, then return the results.  So caller can use search to find if
 * a certain node is in the tree.  Can combine breadth-first and depth-first search into one class that
 * implements those two strategies as separate methods that internally use the appropriate tree iterator.
