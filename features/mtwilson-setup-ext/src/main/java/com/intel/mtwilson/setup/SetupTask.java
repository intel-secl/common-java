/**
 * Each implementation of SetupTask is a bean with attributes (setters and getters)
 * that
 * can be used by the application to configure that bean before execution and
 * to learn about its final configuration after execution. 
 * The setters and getters should use specific classes to give a hint to 
 * the application about the type of data the user needs to provide. 
 * 
 * Recommended application actions:
 * 
 * required && configured:   show current configuration, allow user to change if desired, then run
 * 
 * required && !configured:  show current configuration, highlight what must be configured that isn't already, then run (well, re-evaluate and run if it's configured)
 * 
 * !required && configured:  show current configuration, note that it seems to already be set up
 * 
 * !required && !configured: show current configuration, note that it seems to already be set up but may be missing some configuration anyway
 * 
 * Update: required was changed to validated so in the above table required = !validated.
