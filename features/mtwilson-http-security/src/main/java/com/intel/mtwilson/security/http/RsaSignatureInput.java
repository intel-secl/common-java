/**
 * This class requires the following libraries:
 * org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils from commons-lang
 * 
 * This class defines the format of the content which is hashed to produce
 * the RSA asymmetric-key signature for the "PublicKey" or "X509" authentication
 * scheme. This class could probably also
 * be used with other signature algorithms. The structure of the document
 * to sign is different between MtWilson and PublicKey authentication schemes.
 * 
 * This class allows the inclusion of arbitrary headers (including nonce and
 * timestamp) into the signed document, giving the HTTP Agent and Web Service a 
 * lot of flexibility in determining just what should or shouldn't be included
 * in the signed document, without duplicating information from standard
 * HTTP headers into the Authorization header.
 * 
 * Mt Wilson 2.0 clients MUST include the Date header in the request
 * and cover it with the signature.
